# PIZZA SALES Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to perform an in-depth sales analysis of a pizza restaurant using SQL and Power BI. By transforming raw transactional data into actionable insights, the goal is to help the business:

Monitor overall performance through key performance indicators (KPIs)

Identify top and bottom-selling pizzas by revenue, quantity, and order frequency

Understand customer purchase behavior through time-based trends

Analyze sales contribution by pizza category and size

Support data-driven decision-making for inventory, marketing, and menu optimization

How many pizzas have been sold in total?

How many unique orders have been placed?

On average, how many pizzas are there in each order?

B. Time-Based Analysis
What is the daily trend of total orders across the week?

What is the monthly trend of total orders throughout the year?

C. Category and Size Insights
What percentage of total sales comes from each pizza category?

What percentage of total sales comes from each pizza size?

D. Product Performance
How many pizzas were sold in each category during the month of February?

Which are the top 5 pizzas that generated the highest revenue?

Which are the bottom 5 pizzas that generated the lowest revenue?

Which are the top 5 pizzas with the highest quantity sold?

Which are the bottom 5 pizzas with the lowest quantity sold?

Which are the top 5 pizzas with the highest number of total orders?

Which are the bottom 5 pizzas with the lowest number of total orders?

## Process
This project analyzes a pizza restaurant's sales data using SQL and Power BI. It includes key KPIs like total revenue, average order value, and total pizzas sold. The dashboard visualizes daily and monthly order trends, top/bottom pizzas by revenue, quantity, and order count. Sales by pizza category and size are also analyzed. The project helps drive data-based decisions in sales, marketing, and product strategy.

## Project Insights
1.Large pizzas generated the highest revenue among all pizza sizes, indicating customer preference for bigger portions.

2.Classic and Supreme categories contributed the most to overall sales, both in revenue and quantity sold.

3.The highest number of orders were placed on weekends, especially Saturdays, suggesting peak business during leisure days.

4.A few specific pizzas consistently appeared in the top 5 by revenue and quantity, highlighting strong customer favorites.

5.Some pizzas had high order frequency but low revenue, indicating they could be upsold or bundled to increase profits.

6.The average number of pizzas per order was relatively low (~2), suggesting single-person or    small-group orders dominate.

7.February showed a drop in category-level sales, which may indicate seasonal patterns or fewer   marketing campaigns.

## Final Conclusion
The Pizza Sales Analysis project provided valuable insights into customer preferences, sales trends, and product performance. By using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization, we identified which pizza types and sizes contribute most to revenue, which days drive the highest orders, and which products need marketing or menu adjustments. These findings can help the business optimize inventory, focus promotions on bestsellers, and improve overall decision-making with data-driven strategies.
